            Hi! Welcome to my website! My name is Sejal Mogalgiddi and I am a current sophomore at the University of
            Central Florida.
            I made this website to display all my projects (even those that are currently in progress).
            Please note that I have no professional experience with HTML, CSS, and JS so this website might look a
            little rough as I keep working on it.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for visiting my website!

                    were released for 2025 models. We used city fuel efficiency to predict highway<br>
